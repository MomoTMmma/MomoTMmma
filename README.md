Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Melissa Arreola, a recent graduate of the Coding Temple bootcamp where I gained experience in HTML, CSS, Python, React.js, and Flask. Currently, I'm putting the finishing touches on my Purple Crochet capstone project, an online platform for purchasing handmade crochets. If you're interested in collaborating or just want to chat, feel free to reach out to me at meliskaarreola@gmail.com.
